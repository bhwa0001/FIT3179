        <div class="legend-note">
            <p>Our planet's landscapes are constantly changing. From forests to farmlands, grasslands to urban spaces. Understanding these shifts helps us comprehend humanity's footprint on Earth's ecosystems.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Global Forest Area Change (1990-2020)</h2>
        <div id="deforestation_map"></div>
        
        <div class="legend-note">
            <p>In the past 25 years, there has been drastic shifts in how our planet looks like.</p>
            <p>In most places, there has been a slight decrease in total forest cover hinting at raised deforestation trends.</p>
            <p>A few outliers should be noted, China has over 60,000,000 hectares MORE forest cover compared to 1990.</p>
            <p>On the other side of the spectrum, Brazil has lost over 90,000,000 hectares of forest, mainly using the Amazon rainforest to fuel agricultural demands.</p>

        <h2>Tree Cover Loss by Cause (2001-2024)</h2>
        <div id="deforestation_cause"></div>
        
        <div class="legend-note">
            <p>This normalized stacked area chart shows the proportional contribution of different causes to tree cover loss over time. Use the dropdown menu to filter by country or view all countries combined.</p>
            <p>We can see that Australia's leading cause of deforestation is wildfires, varying drastically from China (logging) and Brazil (Agriculture).</p>
            <p>Brazil fits the assumption that most deforestation is caused by agricultural practices.</p>
            <p><b>A factor that has significant share in all three countries is logging.</b></p>

        <h2>Australia Land Cover Classes 2000-2024</h2>
        <div id="land_covers"></div>
        
        <div class="legend-note">
            <p>Now let's explore the makeup of Australia's landcover throughout the past couple decades.</p>
            <p>It seems for most of the 2000's, tree covered areas and herbaceous crops dominated the landscape.</p>
                Interestingly grassland has seen a rise in land cover proportion in the past decade.</p>
            <p>Touching back on the wildfires of 2019-2020, <b>tree covered areas peaked</b> in share of land cover.
                During this time, grasslands went from rank 1, all the way down to rank 4, back to rank 1 after the fires.
                We can conclude that while wildfires did contribute to significant deforestation, they affect grasslands even more.
            <p>Sidenote, 'other' land cover can refer to anything beyond the specified classes, such as artificial/man-made surfaces.</p>
            <p>Next, let's take a look at how Australia's marine ecosystems are faring.</p>

        <h2>Seagrass marine cover in Australia</h2>
        <div id="seagrass"></div>
        
        <div class="legend-note">
            <p>Hugely important for carbon storage (“blue carbon”), biodiversity, and fish nurseries.</p>
            <p>Australia has some of the largest and most diverse seagrass meadows in the world (Shark Bay, Great Barrier Reef, Spencer Gulf, etc.).</p>
            <p>Queensland and Northern Territory is home to a majority of Australia's seagrass. However, it is estimated that over 30% has been lost since the 19th century. Preservation efforts are important in maintaining our healthy marine ecosystems.</p>
